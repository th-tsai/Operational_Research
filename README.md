# Operational Research Projects

This repository includes works I have done at the University of Edinburgh in 23/34. 

During these projects, I solved various optimisation problems (production planning, scheduling, warehouse location problems, etc.) using mixed integer programming and metaheuristics. 

The software tools used for these projects were FICO Xpress and Python.
