This repo contains four assessments of MATH10072 Methodology, Modelling and Consulting Skills at the University of Edinburgh in 2023.

The first three assessments were co-edited with Takae Hayashi. Those projects involve optimisation of production plans, scheduling, and farming plans with sensitivity analysis.

The fourth assessment is a four-person group project provided by Sopra Steria. The authors are Ting-hung Tsai (me), Takae Hayashi, Rasika Dalvi and Yukta Bhange.

All these projects are optimisation problems and the software used is FICO Xpress and Xpress in Python.
