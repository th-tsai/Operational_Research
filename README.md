# Operational Research Projects

This repository includes four assessments from the "Methodology, Modelling and Consulting Skills" course, and two assessments from the "Risk and Logistics" course at the University of Edinburgh for the academic year 2023/2024. 

During these projects, I solved various optimisation problems related to production planning, scheduling, warehouse location problems and so on using mixed integer programming and metaheuristics. 

The software tools used for these projects were FICO Xpress and Python.
